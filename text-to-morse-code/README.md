# Text to Morse Code

## Description
Welcome to my terminal Text to Morse code application that will help you translate ASCII text to morse code. The application is 
written in Python. I hope you enjoy and I am open to all contributions.

## Guide
<ol>
<li>When the user runs the application they will receive a prompt asking them to type the text that they would like to 
convert to Morse code.</li>
<li>The user will then type in the text (Limited to just letters and numbers) then press enter.</li>
<li>The application will then display the text in morse code as expected. After that the user will be prompted to 
translate more text.</li>
<li>If the user has no more text to translate, the application closes.</li>
</ol>
